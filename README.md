# Anomaly-Detection-and-RUL-Prediction---Bearing-Dataset

This project implements an end‑to‑end predictive maintenance pipeline on the NASA IMS Bearing dataset for both anomaly detection and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. The data consists of high‑frequency vibration signals from four bearings recorded during run‑to‑failure experiments under constant load and speed conditions, where specific bearings eventually develop outer‑race faults and fail. The raw ASCII files are automatically loaded from the nested folder structure (2nd_test and 3rd_test), converted from filenames to timestamps, and aggregated into a time‑series of engineered features such as per‑bearing RMS and kurtosis, with RUL labels computed from the failure time for each test run.

The modeling approach is based on a multi‑task Transformer architecture designed for time‑series. Sliding windows of vibration features (e.g., 30 time steps × 8 features) are fed into a shared Transformer encoder with positional encoding and multi‑head self‑attention to capture long‑range temporal dependencies across all bearings. The network has two output heads: a reconstruction head that tries to rebuild the original input window (self‑supervised learning) and a regression head that predicts the RUL in minutes for the final time step of each window. The model is trained jointly to minimize both reconstruction loss (for learning normal behavior) and RUL error (for prognostics), enabling it to function as both an unsupervised anomaly detector and a supervised RUL predictor on the same backbone.

For anomaly detection, the reconstruction error (mean squared error between input and reconstructed window) is monitored over time. During healthy operation this error remains low and stable, but it rises sharply as the bearing approaches failure, allowing the definition of a dynamic anomaly threshold and an approximate First Prediction Time (FPT). For RUL, the regression head outputs a continuous estimate of remaining life, which is evaluated against the ground‑truth RUL curve for the final test set. The project includes visualizations of (1) reconstruction error vs. time, highlighting the anomaly onset, and (2) actual vs. predicted RUL, demonstrating how the Transformer’s predictions track the degradation trajectory toward failure. Together, these components form a complete predictive analytics solution that turns raw vibration data into actionable maintenance insights suitable for real‑world manufacturing and reliability engineering use cases.
